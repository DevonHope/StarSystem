## Description

A procedurally generated planetary system using OpenGL, developed on Linux and Windows platforms. The project will consist of a primary top-down view of the planetary (solar) system with the star(s) at the centre. Orbital paths will be shown around the star(s) with the orbiting object (planets, asteroids, etc) shown at a visible scale
